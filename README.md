I can't figure out how to create a break for the user output. The requirements are:
One piece of information per line.  For example, on the first line we should see:
Interviewee Information Page
Candidate name:  Joe Schmoe
Candidate email address: joe@gmail.com
The only hint I get is: to show information on separate lines--instead of it running all together--include an HTML break tag in your text literal.  For example, this will show the two words on separate lines:
"Hello<br />world"
I can't get the inputted text to populate into a seperate line when I test it in a browser.
